# Spring WebFlux - Spring Reactive Programming

# Reactive
Reactive systems have certain characteristics that make them ideal for low-latency, 
high-throughput workloads. Project Reactor and the Spring portfolio work together to 
enable developers to build enterprise-grade reactive systems that are responsive, 
resilient, elastic, and message-driven. https://spring.io/reactive

If you are looking to develop a web application or Rest web service on non-blocking reactive model, then you can look into Spring WebFlux. Spring WebFlux is supported on Tomcat, Jetty, Servlet 3.1+ containers, as well as on non-Servlet runtimes such as Netty and Undertow. Spring WebFlux is built on Project Reactor. Project Reactor is the implementation of Reactive Streams specification. Reactor provides two types:

### Mono:
implements Publisher and returns 0 or 1 elements

### Flux: 
implements Publisher and returns N elements.
